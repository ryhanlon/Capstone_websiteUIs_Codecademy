Learn Accessibility Cumulative Project


In this project, you’ll apply your knowledge of semantic, accessible markup to refactor an existing website.

To complete this project, you will need a screen reader installed on your computer or web browser. Additionally, you should work with the students in your cohort (via Slack) to compare notes and code during the refactoring process.

Ready to start? Great. Let’s get going.
